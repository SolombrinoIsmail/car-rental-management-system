## Technical Stack (Simplified)
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js (single web app)
- **Backend:** Supabase (database, auth, storage)

- **No offline mode initially** - Requires stable internet

## Realistic Success Metrics

## Risk-Adjusted Approach
1. Start with ONE complete workflow (digital contracts)
2. Get 3 beta customers before adding features

5. Manual workarounds acceptable initially

## What's NOT in MVP
