## üö® Issues by Priority

### BLOCKERS (Must fix before Sprint 1)

1. **Technology Stack Decision**
   - Frontend framework (React/Vue/Angular?)
   - Backend language (Node.js/Python/Java?)
   - Database choice (PostgreSQL/MySQL?)
   - **Action:** Architecture meeting by end of week

2. **Payment Gateway Selection**
   - Swiss payment provider (Datatrans/Stripe/SIX?)
   - QR-bill library selection
   - **Action:** Evaluate providers, check APIs

3. **Infrastructure Decision**
   - Hosting (AWS/Azure/Swiss provider?)
   - CI/CD pipeline tools
   - **Action:** DevOps consultation needed

### HIGH PRIORITY (Fix in Sprint 0)

1. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Define "2-minute contract" breakdown
   - API response time targets
   - Concurrent user expectations
   - **Action:** Add to NFRs

2. **Data Migration Plan**
   - How to import existing customer data
   - Vehicle fleet import strategy
   - **Action:** Create migration stories

3. **Mobile Testing Devices**
   - Tablet specifications for signatures
   - Mobile browser requirements
   - **Action:** Procurement plan

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Address by Sprint 2)

1. **Monitoring Strategy**
   - Application monitoring tools
   - Error tracking system
   - Performance monitoring
2. **Backup & Recovery Testing**
   - DR procedures
   - Backup validation

## üéØ MVP Scope Validation

### Confirmed MVP Features (Phase 1-2)

‚úÖ Digital contracts with 2-minute flow ‚úÖ Customer & vehicle management ‚úÖ Payment processing with
QR bills ‚úÖ Photo documentation system ‚úÖ Basic dashboards ‚úÖ Dispute handling

### Correctly Deferred (Phase 3+)

‚úÖ Reservation system (Phase 4) ‚úÖ Advanced analytics (Phase 3) ‚úÖ Custom reports (Phase 3)

### Risk: Potential Scope Creep

‚ö†Ô∏è GDPR features might need earlier implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è Offline mode may be required sooner than
planned

## üíª Technical Readiness Assessment

### Ready ‚úÖ

- Database schema well-defined
- API endpoints specified
- Business logic clear
- Security requirements documented

### Needs Architect Input üîß
