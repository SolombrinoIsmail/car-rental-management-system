# Story 03: Audit Trail System

**Story ID:** CRMS-063  
**Epic:** Epic 6 - System Administration & Security  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Ready for Development

## User Story Statement

**As an** owner/admin  
**I want to** track all system activities with comprehensive audit trails  
**So that** I have complete accountability, compliance, and can investigate any issues or disputes

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

   - Capture before/after values for all data changes with field-level granularity
   - Record entity type, entity ID, operation type, and affected fields
   - Track bulk operations with detailed change summaries

2. **User Activity Monitoring**
   - Log all user actions with precise timestamps (ISO 8601 with timezone)
   - Record user ID, session ID, IP address, and user agent for each action
   - Track navigation patterns and feature usage for operational insights
   - Monitor administrative actions with enhanced detail for security purposes

3. **Payment Transaction Logging**
   - Immutable records of all payment transactions with complete details
   - Track payment method changes, refund requests, and dispute resolutions
   - Log integration events with external payment processors
   - Record all financial adjustments with proper authorization chains

4. **System Access Logging**
   - Track all successful and failed login attempts with geolocation data
   - Record session creation, termination, and timeout events
   - Log password changes, 2FA setup/disable, and account modifications
   - Monitor privilege escalations and role changes

5. **Search and Query Capabilities**
   - Full-text search across all audit log entries
   - Advanced filtering by date range, user, entity type, and action type
   - Search by entity ID to trace complete lifecycle of business objects
   - Saved search queries for common investigation patterns

6. **Audit Report Generation**
   - Pre-built reports for common compliance and operational needs
   - Custom report builder with drag-and-drop interface
   - Automated daily/weekly/monthly audit summaries

   - Payment transactions create immutable audit records
   - System events (login, logout, errors) are properly logged

2. **Search and Query Functionality**
   - Full-text search returns relevant results quickly
   - Date range filtering works correctly across partitioned tables
   - Entity-specific queries show complete change history
   - Complex multi-filter queries perform within acceptable limits

3. **Report Generation**
   - Pre-built compliance reports generate accurate data
   - Custom reports respect user permissions and data access rules
   - Large reports generate successfully without timeout
   - Report exports maintain data integrity and formatting

4. **Data Integrity and Security**
   - Audit logs cannot be modified after creation
   - Integrity hashes detect any tampering attempts
   - Access controls prevent unauthorized audit log access
   - Data encryption protects sensitive audit information

5. **Performance and Scalability**
   - High-volume logging doesn't impact application performance
   - Query performance remains acceptable with months of audit data
   - Partitioning strategy effectively manages large datasets
   - Archival process works correctly without data loss

6. **Retention and Cleanup**
   - Automated retention policies execute on schedule
   - Data archival maintains searchability for required periods
   - GDPR deletion requests properly remove user data
   - Archive integrity verification works correctly

7. **Alert and Monitoring**
   - Real-time alerts trigger for configured security events
   - Alert cooldown periods prevent notification spam
   - System health monitoring detects audit system issues
   - Integration with external monitoring tools works correctly

8. **Compliance and Regulatory**
   - GDPR processing activity reports include required information
   - Financial audit trails meet regulatory standards
   - Data export for compliance requests works correctly
   - Audit log format compatible with legal discovery tools
