## UI/UX Considerations

- **Customer Self-Service Portal:** Simple, accessible interface for rights requests
- **Admin GDPR Dashboard:** Comprehensive overview of compliance status and pending requests
- **Consent Management Interface:** Clear, granular consent options with plain language
- **Request Tracking:** Visual timeline showing request progress and remaining time
- **Data Export Viewer:** User-friendly display of exported personal data
- **Breach Response Console:** Workflow-driven interface for incident management
- **Retention Policy Manager:** Drag-and-drop interface for policy configuration
- **Compliance Reporting:** Visual dashboards with charts and compliance metrics
- **Mobile Optimization:** Responsive design for customer portal access
- **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant for inclusive access

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Data Subject Access Rights**
   - Customer data export includes all personal information across all systems
   - Export formats (JSON, PDF) are accurate and complete
   - Self-service portal properly verifies customer identity
   - Admin can fulfill access requests within required timeframes

2. **Right to Erasure**
   - Customer deletion removes all personal data while preserving business records
   - Cascading deletion works correctly across related entities
   - Anonymization properly removes identifying information
   - Business-critical data is preserved according to legal requirements

3. **Consent Management**
   - Granular consent collection works for different processing purposes
   - Consent withdrawal immediately stops relevant data processing
   - Consent history tracking provides complete audit trail
   - Re-consent mechanisms work when privacy policy changes

4. **Data Retention Enforcement**
   - Automated retention policies execute on schedule
   - Different retention periods are applied correctly by data type
   - Manual exceptions can be applied with proper justification
   - Retention reports show compliance status accurately

5. **Breach Response System**
   - Incident classification and escalation works correctly
   - Authority notifications are generated within 72-hour requirement
   - Customer notifications are sent for high-risk breaches
   - Breach impact assessment tools provide accurate analysis

6. **Processing Activities Management**
   - Complete mapping of data processing activities
   - Legal basis documentation is comprehensive and accurate
   - Regular review processes maintain up-to-date records
   - Processing activity reports meet regulatory requirements

7. **Privacy Policy Management**
   - Version control maintains history of policy changes
   - Customer notifications are sent when policies change materially
   - Multi-language support works correctly for international compliance
   - Re-consent collection works when required

8. **Performance and Scalability**
   - Data export generation completes within reasonable timeframes
   - Large-scale deletion operations don't impact system performance
   - Retention policy enforcement scales with database size
   - Consent management performs well under high user loads
