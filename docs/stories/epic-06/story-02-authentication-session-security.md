# Story 02: Authentication & Session Security

**Story ID:** CRMS-062  
**Epic:** Epic 6 - System Administration & Security  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Ready for Development

## User Story Statement

**As a** system user  
**I want to** securely access the system with strong authentication  
**So that** business data remains protected and unauthorized access is prevented

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

1. **Secure Login System**
   - Standard login with username/email and password
   - Optional two-factor authentication (2FA) via TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)
   - SMS-based 2FA as fallback option for users without smartphone apps
   - Remember device option for trusted devices (30-day expiration)

2. **Password Complexity Requirements**
   - Minimum 12 characters with mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
   - Dictionary word checking to prevent common passwords
   - Personal information checking (no names, birthdates, etc.)
   - Password strength indicator with real-time feedback during creation

3. **Session Management**
   - Automatic session timeout after 2 hours of inactivity
   - Warning notification 10 minutes before session expiration
   - Secure session tokens using JWT with short expiration times
   - Refresh token mechanism for seamless session renewal

4. **Concurrent Session Control**
   - Configurable maximum concurrent sessions per user (default: 3)
   - Display active sessions with location, device, and last activity
   - User ability to terminate their own sessions remotely
   - Admin ability to force-terminate any user's sessions

5. **Account Recovery Process**
   - Self-service password reset via email with secure, time-limited tokens
   - Security questions as additional verification layer
   - Account lockout recovery process with admin approval
   - Backup recovery codes for 2FA-enabled accounts

6. **Login Attempt Monitoring**
   - Track failed login attempts with IP address and timestamp
   - Progressive delays after failed attempts (exponential backoff)
   - Account lockout after 5 consecutive failures
   - CAPTCHA challenge after 3 failed attempts from same IP

7. **Brute Force Protection**
   - IP-based rate limiting for login attempts
   - Geolocation-based suspicious activity detection
   - Temporary IP blocking for repeated failures across multiple accounts
   - Admin notifications for potential security threats

8. **Device and Browser Security**
   - Device fingerprinting for additional security layer
   - Browser security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)
   - Secure cookie configuration with HttpOnly and Secure flags
   - Automatic logout on browser/tab close (configurable)

9. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - TOTP-based 2FA with QR code setup
   - Backup codes for account recovery (10 single-use codes)
   - Hardware token support (YubiKey) for high-security accounts
   - Admin enforcement of 2FA for specific roles

10. **Security Event Logging**
    - Log all authentication attempts (successful and failed)
    - Track password changes, 2FA setup/disable events
    - Record suspicious activities (multiple failed logins, unusual locations)
    - Integration with security information and event management (SIEM)

11. **Password Policy Enforcement**
    - Configurable password expiration (90 days default)
    - Password history tracking (prevent reuse of last 12 passwords)
    - Force password change for new users on first login
    - Admin ability to force password reset for specific users

12. **Advanced Security Features**
    - Risk-based authentication (unusual location, device, time triggers additional verification)
    - Integration with threat intelligence feeds for known malicious IPs
    - Behavioral analysis for detecting account compromise
    - Zero-knowledge password recovery option for high-security environments

## Technical Implementation Notes

- **Authentication Framework:** JWT-based with RS256 signing, 15-minute access tokens
- **2FA Implementation:** TOTP using Google Authenticator compatible library (otpauth://)
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with minimum 12 salt rounds, consider Argon2id for future
- **Session Storage:** Redis cluster for distributed session management
- **Rate Limiting:** Redis-based sliding window rate limiter
- **Security Headers:** Helmet.js for Express or equivalent security middleware
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM for sensitive data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Geolocation:** MaxMind GeoIP2 or similar service for location-based security

- **2FA Setup:** Step-by-step wizard with QR code display and backup code generation
- **Session Management:** User-friendly session list with device icons and location info
- **Password Strength:** Real-time visual feedback with color-coded strength indicator
- **Security Dashboard:** Personal security overview showing recent activity and settings
- **Mobile Experience:** Touch-friendly interface optimized for mobile device login
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- **Loading States:** Clear indicators during authentication processes
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages without revealing security information
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Graceful degradation for users with JavaScript disabled

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Authentication Flow**
   - Valid credentials allow successful login with proper session creation
   - Invalid credentials show appropriate error without revealing account existence
   - Account lockout triggers after configured number of failed attempts
   - Session timeout works correctly with warning notifications

2. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - 2FA setup process completes successfully with valid TOTP codes
   - Backup codes work correctly for account recovery
   - 2FA can be disabled with proper verification
   - Hardware token authentication works for supported devices

3. **Password Security**
   - Password complexity requirements are enforced during creation/change
   - Password reset email contains valid, time-limited tokens
   - Old passwords cannot be reused according to history policy
   - Password expiration triggers forced change with proper notification

4. **Session Security**
   - Multiple concurrent sessions work within configured limits
   - Session termination works correctly from different devices
   - Inactive sessions timeout automatically
   - Admin can force-terminate user sessions

5. **Brute Force Protection**
   - Rate limiting prevents rapid-fire login attempts
   - IP blocking triggers after multiple account attacks
   - CAPTCHA challenges appear at appropriate thresholds
   - Geolocation-based alerts trigger for unusual login locations

6. **Account Recovery**
   - Password reset process works end-to-end with email verification
   - Account unlock process requires proper admin approval
   - Recovery process handles edge cases (expired tokens, multiple requests)
   - Security questions provide additional verification layer

7. **Security Event Logging**
   - All authentication events are logged with proper details
   - Suspicious activities trigger appropriate alerts
   - Log data is properly encrypted and immutable
   - Integration with monitoring systems works correctly

8. **Performance and Scalability**
   - Authentication system handles expected concurrent user load
   - Session management scales with Redis clustering
   - Database queries are optimized for authentication workflows
   - Rate limiting doesn't significantly impact legitimate users
