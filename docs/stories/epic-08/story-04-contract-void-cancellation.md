# Story 4: Contract Void & Cancellation

## Story ID

**Epic:** 08 - Dispute & Exception Handling  
**Story:** 04  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Phase:** 2 (Week 7)

## User Story Statement

**As a** rental staff member  
**I want to** void incorrect contracts systematically  
**So that** mistakes can be corrected quickly while maintaining proper documentation and financial
integrity

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-01: Void Contract Initiation

- **Given** a contract needs to be voided
- **When** staff initiates void process
- **Then** the system validates void eligibility based on contract status
- **And** requires reason code selection from predefined categories

### AC-02: Void Reason Documentation

- **Given** a contract void request
- **When** documenting the void reason
- **Then** the system captures detailed explanation beyond reason codes
- **And** requires supporting evidence when applicable

### AC-03: Contract Status Validation

- **Given** a void request is submitted
- **When** the system validates the request
- **Then** contracts in active rental status require manager approval
- **And** completed contracts have restricted void permissions

### AC-04: Vehicle Immediate Release

- **Given** an active contract is voided
- **When** the void is processed
- **Then** the system immediately releases the vehicle from rental
- **And** updates vehicle availability status in real-time

### AC-05: Charge Reversal Processing

- **Given** a voided contract with processed payments
- **When** financial reversal is required
- **Then** the system reverses all associated charges automatically
- **And** processes refunds through original payment methods

### AC-06: Replacement Contract Creation

- **Given** a void requires contract replacement
- **When** creating replacement contract
- **Then** the system pre-fills data from voided contract
- **And** links replacement to original for audit purposes

### AC-07: Void Permission Controls

- **Given** different user roles
- **When** attempting contract voids
- **Then** the system enforces role-based void permissions
- **And** escalates high-value voids to management approval

### AC-08: Financial Impact Tracking

- **Given** voided contracts
- **When** calculating business impact
- **Then** the system tracks revenue impact of voids
- **And** categorizes impact by void reason for analysis

### AC-09: Customer Notification

- **Given** a contract void completion
- **When** processing customer communication
- **Then** the system sends void confirmation with explanation
- **And** provides replacement contract details if applicable

### AC-10: Audit Trail Maintenance

- **Given** any void-related activity
- **When** actions are performed
- **Then** the system maintains immutable void audit records
- **And** tracks all state changes with timestamps

### AC-11: Void History Tracking

- **Given** voided contracts
- **When** reviewing contract history
- **Then** the system maintains searchable void history
- **And** provides void trend analysis for operational improvement

### AC-12: Integration Consistency

- **Given** voided contracts
- **When** interfacing with external systems
- **Then** the system updates all integrated systems consistently
- **And** maintains data integrity across all platforms

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backend Components

- **ContractVoidService:** Core void processing logic
- **FinancialReversalEngine:** Automated charge reversal system
- **VehicleReleaseManager:** Immediate availability updates

- **Notification Rules:** Customer and stakeholder communication

### Integration Requirements

- Payment gateway reversal APIs
- Vehicle management system updates
- Accounting system transaction reversals
- Customer communication platform integration

    void_reason_code VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    detailed_reason TEXT,
    voided_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    approved_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    void_timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    original_value DECIMAL(12,2),
    refund_amount DECIMAL(12,2),
    refund_processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    replacement_contract_id UUID REFERENCES contracts(id),
    customer_notified_at TIMESTAMP,
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'processing'
);
```

### Charge Reversals Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE charge_reversals (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    void_record_id UUID REFERENCES contract_void_records(id),
    original_charge_id UUID,
    charge_type VARCHAR(50),
    original_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
