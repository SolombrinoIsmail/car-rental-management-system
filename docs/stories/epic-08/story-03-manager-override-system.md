# Story 3: Manager Override System

## Story ID

**Epic:** 08 - Dispute & Exception Handling  
**Story:** 03  
**Priority:** High  
**Phase:** 2 (Week 7)

## User Story Statement

**As a** manager  
**I want to** override system restrictions and approve exceptions  
**So that** exceptional circumstances can be handled while maintaining proper controls and
accountability

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### AC-01: Override Authority Configuration

- **Given** manager roles are defined
- **When** configuring override permissions
- **Then** the system allows setting override limits by manager level
- **And** supports different authority levels for different override types

### AC-02: Pricing Rule Override

- **Given** exceptional pricing situations
- **When** manager applies pricing override
- **Then** the system allows bypass of standard pricing rules
- **And** requires documented justification for the override

### AC-03: Fee and Charge Waiver

- **Given** customer satisfaction concerns
- **When** manager waives fees
- **Then** the system supports partial or full fee waivers
- **And** tracks waived amounts against revenue impact metrics

### AC-04: Policy Exception Approval

- **Given** situations requiring policy flexibility
- **When** staff requests policy exception
- **Then** the system routes request to appropriate manager
- **And** provides policy context and risk assessment

### AC-05: Override Reason Documentation

- **Given** any manager override action
- **When** override is applied
- **Then** the system requires detailed reason selection
- **And** captures additional explanatory notes

### AC-06: Multi-Level Approval Process

- **Given** high-value overrides
- **When** override exceeds manager authority
- **Then** the system escalates to senior management
- **And** maintains approval chain visibility

### AC-07: Real-Time Override Tracking

- **Given** manager override activities
- **When** monitoring system usage
- **Then** the system tracks override frequency and patterns
- **And** provides real-time dashboard of override activity

### AC-08: Override Limit Enforcement

- **Given** configured override limits
- **When** manager attempts override
- **Then** the system enforces monetary and frequency limits
- **And** prevents unauthorized override attempts

### AC-09: Audit Trail Generation

- **Given** override actions performed
- **When** audit review is required
- **Then** the system maintains comprehensive override logs
- **And** includes before/after states for all changes

### AC-10: Override Impact Analysis

- **Given** completed overrides
- **When** analyzing business impact
- **Then** the system calculates revenue impact
- **And** tracks customer satisfaction correlation

### AC-11: Emergency Override Capability

- **Given** critical situations
- **When** emergency override is needed
- **Then** the system provides elevated emergency access
- **And** requires post-action justification review

### AC-12: Override Performance Metrics

- **Given** manager override usage
- **When** evaluating manager performance
- **Then** the system tracks override success rates
- **And** measures impact on customer retention

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backend Components

- **OverrideService:** Core override management logic
- **PermissionEngine:** Authority level validation
