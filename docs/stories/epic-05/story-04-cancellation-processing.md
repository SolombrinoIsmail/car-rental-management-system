## Technical Implementation Notes

### Cancellation Policy Engine
- **Time-based Rules:** Different policies based on hours/days before pickup
- **Reservation Type:** Standard vs. special rates may have different policies
- **Customer Tier:** Loyalty status may affect cancellation terms
- **Seasonal Adjustments:** Peak periods may have stricter policies

### Policy Examples
```
Standard Policy:
- 48+ hours before: Full refund
- 24-48 hours: 50% cancellation fee
- 6-24 hours: 75% cancellation fee  
- <6 hours: No refund

Premium Policy:
- 24+ hours before: Full refund
- 6-24 hours: 25% cancellation fee
- <6 hours: 50% cancellation fee
```

### Financial Integration
- Automatic refund processing for card payments
- Manual refund tracking for cash/other payments
- Accounting integration for revenue recognition
- Tax adjustment calculations

## Database Schema Requirements

### New Tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE cancellation_policies (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    policy_rules JSONB NOT NULL, -- Array of time-based rules
    applies_to_reservation_types VARCHAR[], -- standard, premium, etc.
    active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE reservation_cancellations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    reservation_id UUID REFERENCES reservations(id),
    policy_applied VARCHAR(50),
    cancellation_reason VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    reason_details TEXT,
    original_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    cancellation_fee DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0,
    refund_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    refund_method VARCHAR(20), -- original_payment, cash, check, credit
    refund_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending', -- pending, processing, completed, failed
    policy_overridden BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    override_reason TEXT,
    override_approved_by UUID REFERENCES staff(id),
    processed_by UUID REFERENCES staff(id),
    processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    description VARCHAR(200),
    category VARCHAR(50), -- customer, operational, system
    requires_details BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    affects_customer_standing BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);
```

### Updated Tables
```sql
ALTER TABLE reservations ADD COLUMN cancelled_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE reservations ADD COLUMN cancellation_id UUID REFERENCES reservation_cancellations(id);
```

### Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_cancellations_reservation ON reservation_cancellations(reservation_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_cancellations_date ON reservation_cancellations(processed_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_cancellations_refund_status ON reservation_cancellations(refund_status);
```

## UI/UX Considerations

### Cancellation Interface
- **Reservation Lookup:** Quick search by confirmation number or customer
- **Policy Display:** Clear explanation of applicable fees before confirmation
- **Reason Selection:** Dropdown with common reasons plus free-text details
- **Override Workflow:** Escalation process for exceptional cases
- **Confirmation Summary:** Complete breakdown of fees and refund amounts

### Customer Communication
- **Professional Templates:** Branded cancellation confirmations
- **Fee Transparency:** Clear explanation of why fees apply
- **Refund Timeline:** Expected processing times for different payment methods
- **Contact Information:** Support details for questions or disputes

### Staff Tools
- **Policy Calculator:** Real-time fee calculations as staff input details
- **Override Approval:** Workflow for manager approval of policy exceptions
- **Batch Processing:** Handle multiple cancellations efficiently
- **Reporting Dashboard:** Track cancellation trends and impacts

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Cancellation Within Policy
**Given:** Customer calls to cancel reservation 72 hours before pickup  
**When:** Staff processes cancellation with "customer request" reason  
**Then:** Full refund processed, confirmation sent, vehicle immediately available

### Scenario 2: Late Cancellation with Fees
**Given:** Reservation cancelled 12 hours before pickup  
**When:** Staff processes cancellation  
**Then:** Cancellation fee applied per policy, partial refund processed, customer notified

### Scenario 3: No-Show Conversion to Cancellation
**Given:** No-show customer contacts within 24 hours  
**When:** Staff converts no-show to voluntary cancellation  
**Then:** Lesser fee applied than no-show fee, goodwill maintained

### Scenario 4: Policy Override for Emergency
**Given:** Customer has medical emergency 6 hours before pickup  
**When:** Staff requests policy override  
**Then:** Manager approval workflow initiated, override processed if approved

### Scenario 5: Group Cancellation
**Given:** Multiple reservations for same customer need cancellation  
**When:** Staff processes batch cancellation  
**Then:** All reservations cancelled consistently, single communication sent

### Scenario 6: Partial Refund Processing
**Given:** Customer with complex booking including extras  
**When:** Cancellation processed  
**Then:** Fees calculated on total amount, extras refunded separately if applicable

### Scenario 7: Payment Method Edge Cases
**Given:** Original payment with expired credit card  
**When:** Refund processing attempted  
**Then:** System flags for manual processing, staff notified to contact customer

### Scenario 8: Same-Day Rebooking
**Given:** Vehicle released through cancellation  
**When:** New customer wants immediate booking  
**Then:** Vehicle shows as available, new reservation can be created immediately
