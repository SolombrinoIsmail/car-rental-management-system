## Technical Implementation Notes

### Overbooking Detection Algorithm
```
Overbooking Risk Score = 
    (Total Reservations + Active Rentals - Available Vehicles) 
    × (1 - Historical No-Show Rate)
    × Demand Pressure Factor
    × Seasonal Adjustment Factor

Thresholds:
- Score 0.7-0.8: Early warning
- Score 0.8-0.9: Moderate risk  
- Score 0.9+: High risk, intervention required
```

### Resolution Priority Matrix
1. **Upgrade within fleet** (lowest cost)
2. **Partner network referral** (moderate cost)
3. **Monetary compensation** (higher cost)
4. **Reschedule with incentives** (customer service impact)

### Business Rules Engine
- Maximum overbooking ratio per vehicle category
- Automatic upgrade authorization limits by staff level
- Compensation caps and approval workflows
- Customer priority scoring (loyalty, value, history)

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Proactive Overbooking Detection
**Given:** Historical 6% no-show rate and current 105% booking rate  
**When:** Overbooking risk analysis runs  
**Then:** System flags moderate risk and suggests allowing 1 additional reservation

### Scenario 2: Automatic Upgrade Resolution
**Given:** Confirmed overbooking situation with upgrade options available  
**When:** Staff selects automatic upgrade strategy  
**Then:** Customer receives upgrade offer, cost tracked, vehicle reassigned

### Scenario 3: Partner Network Referral
**Given:** No internal upgrade options available for overbooking  
**When:** System evaluates resolution options  
**Then:** Partner referral suggested with contact details and cost estimates

### Scenario 4: Customer Communication and Response
**Given:** Customer offered upgrade for overbooking resolution  
**When:** Customer accepts upgrade offer  
**Then:** Reservation updated, confirmation sent, incident marked as resolved

### Scenario 5: Management Escalation
**Given:** Severe overbooking situation exceeding staff authorization limits  
**When:** Resolution requires high-cost compensation  
**Then:** Automatic escalation to management with full situation briefing

### Scenario 6: Multi-customer Overbooking
**Given:** 3 customers, 1 vehicle available in same category  
**When:** Staff processes resolution for all affected customers  
**Then:** Tiered resolution strategy applied based on customer priority scores

### Scenario 7: Last-minute Overbooking Resolution
**Given:** Overbooking discovered on pickup day  
**When:** Customer arrives for reserved vehicle  
**Then:** Real-time resolution options presented with immediate implementation

### Scenario 8: Historical Analysis and Prevention
**Given:** Recurring overbooking patterns in specific category/timeframe  
**When:** Management reviews incident reports  
**Then:** Overbooking rules adjusted to prevent future incidents
