# User Story: Offline/Degraded Mode Operations

## Story Information
- **Story ID:** CRITICAL-02
- **Epic:** Epic 6 - System Administration & Security (Addition)
- **Priority:** P0 - Critical (Reliability Requirement)
- **Story Points:** 13

## User Story Statement
**As a** rental staff member  
**I want to** continue serving customers when internet connectivity is lost  
**So that** business operations are not disrupted by technical failures

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Offline Detection & Mode Switching**
   - Automatically detect loss of internet connectivity
   - Switch to offline mode within 5 seconds
   - Clear visual indicator showing offline status
   - Maintain list of pending synchronizations
   - Automatic retry when connection restored

2. **Offline Contract Creation**
   - Create new rental contracts without server connection
   - Access cached customer data (last 30 days active)
   - Access complete vehicle fleet information
   - Generate temporary contract numbers
   - Store contracts locally with encryption

3. **Local Data Caching**
   - Cache last 500 active customers
   - Cache complete vehicle fleet data
   - Cache pricing and rate information
   - Cache contract templates and terms
   - Automatic cache refresh when online

4. **Offline Payment Recording**
   - Record cash payments with manual receipt
   - Queue card payments for later processing
   - Generate temporary payment confirmations
   - Track payment promises for later verification
   - Maintain cash drawer tracking offline

5. **Sync Queue Management**
   - Queue all offline transactions
   - Priority ordering for sync (payments first)
   - Conflict resolution for double-bookings
   - Partial sync capability
   - Manual sync trigger option

6. **Data Conflict Resolution**
   - Detect vehicle double-bookings
   - Alert for customer data conflicts
   - Manager override for conflicts
   - Audit trail of all resolutions
   - Report of all conflicts after sync

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Offline Architecture
```javascript
class OfflineManager {
  constructor() {
    this.storage = new IndexedDB('crms_offline');
    this.syncQueue = new PersistentQueue();
    this.conflictResolver = new ConflictResolver();
  }
  
  strategies = {
    contracts: 'queue_and_sync',
    payments: 'priority_queue',
    updates: 'last_write_wins',
    photos: 'store_locally'
  };
  
  cachePolicy = {
    customers: { max: 500, ttl: '30d' },
    vehicles: { max: 'all', ttl: '1d' },
    prices: { max: 'all', ttl: '7d' }
  };
}
```

### Progressive Web App Setup
- Service Worker for offline capability
- IndexedDB for local storage
- Background sync API for queued operations
- Cache-first strategy for static assets

## API Endpoints

```
GET /api/v1/offline/cache-data
  Response: { 
    customers: [...],
    vehicles: [...],
    prices: [...],
    lastSync: timestamp
  }

POST /api/v1/offline/sync
  Request: { 
    transactions: [...],
    deviceId: 'xxx',
    offlineFrom: timestamp,
    offlineTo: timestamp
  }
  Response: { 
    synced: 45,
    conflicts: 2,
    failed: 1,
    resolutions: [...]
  }

GET /api/v1/offline/status
  Response: {
    mode: 'offline|online|degraded',
    queuedTransactions: 12,
    lastSync: timestamp,
    cacheAge: seconds
  }

POST /api/v1/offline/resolve-conflict
  Request: {
    conflictId: 'xxx',
    resolution: 'accept_local|accept_remote|merge',
    overrideBy: userId
  }
```

## Database Schema Requirements

```sql
-- Offline transaction queue
CREATE TABLE offline_queue (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    device_id VARCHAR(100),
    transaction_type VARCHAR(50),
    transaction_data JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_offline BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    sync_status VARCHAR(20),
    sync_attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    sync_error TEXT,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 5
);

-- Conflict tracking
CREATE TABLE sync_conflicts (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    entity_type VARCHAR(50),
    entity_id UUID,
    local_version JSONB,
    remote_version JSONB,
    detected_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolved_at TIMESTAMP,
    resolution VARCHAR(50),
    resolved_by UUID REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Cache metadata
CREATE TABLE cache_metadata (
    cache_key VARCHAR(100) PRIMARY KEY,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP,
    record_count INTEGER,
    size_bytes BIGINT,
    device_id VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## UI/UX Considerations

### Offline Mode Indicators
- Red banner: "OFFLINE MODE - Transactions will sync when connected"
- Icon changes from cloud to local storage
- Queue counter showing pending transactions
- Last sync timestamp display
- Manual sync button when connection detected

### Degraded Functionality Warnings
- Payment processing: "Cash only in offline mode"
- Customer search: "Showing cached customers only"
- Reservations: "Cannot check future reservations offline"
- Photos: "Photos saved locally, will upload when online"

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Connection Loss During Transaction**
   - Start contract creation online
   - Disconnect network mid-process
   - Verify seamless transition to offline
   - Complete transaction offline

2. **Extended Offline Operation**
   - Operate offline for 8 hours
   - Create 20 contracts
   - Process various payment types
   - Verify all data intact

3. **Sync with Conflicts**
   - Create conflicting bookings offline
   - Restore connection
   - Verify conflict detection
   - Test resolution process

4. **Cache Management**
   - Fill cache to capacity
   - Verify LRU eviction works
   - Test cache refresh on reconnection
   - Verify data integrity

5. **Partial Connectivity**
   - Simulate intermittent connection
   - Verify retry logic
   - Test partial sync capability
   - Ensure no data loss

6. **Performance Testing**
   - Operate with 100 queued transactions
   - Measure sync time
   - Verify UI responsiveness
   - Test battery impact on mobile

7. **Data Integrity**
   - Create complex transaction offline
   - Include photos and signatures
   - Verify complete sync
   - Check data consistency

8. **Security Testing**
   - Verify offline data encryption
   - Test unauthorized access attempts
   - Check cache clearing on logout
   - Verify secure sync protocol
