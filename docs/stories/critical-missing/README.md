## Decision Matrix

| Story              | Skip It? | Workaround            | Impact  | Recommendation |
| ------------------ | -------- | --------------------- | ------- | -------------- |
| Data Migration     | ❌ No    | Manual entry (200hrs) | Extreme | MUST HAVE      |
| Offline Mode       | ❌ No    | None                  | High    | MUST HAVE      |
| Communication      | ⚠️ Maybe | Manual calls          | High    | MUST HAVE      |
| Cash Drawer        | ⚠️ Maybe | Excel tracking        | Medium  | SHOULD HAVE    |
| Corporate Accounts | ✅ Yes   | Manual billing        | Medium  | SHOULD HAVE    |
| Print Management   | ⚠️ Maybe | Manual queue          | Low     | SHOULD HAVE    |

## Stakeholder Communication

### Key Message

"We've identified 3 critical stories that are absolute requirements for launch, and 5 important
stories that will significantly improve operations. Adding these 8 stories will extend timeline by
2-3 weeks but ensure a truly operational system from Day 1."

### Options to Present

1. **Option A:** Add all 8 stories (+3 weeks, complete system)
2. **Option B:** Add 3 critical only (+1 week, minimum viable)
3. **Option C:** Launch without and retrofit (high risk, not recommended)

## Conclusion

The 3 critical stories (Data Migration, Offline Mode, Communication) are **non-negotiable** for
launch. The additional 5 stories are strongly recommended for Week 1 operations.

Without these additions, the system will face:

- Launch delays due to manual data entry
- Daily operational failures during outages
- Overwhelming manual communication burden
- Customer dissatisfaction from day one

**Strong Recommendation:** Add all 8 stories and accept 2-3 week timeline extension for a truly
operational system.
