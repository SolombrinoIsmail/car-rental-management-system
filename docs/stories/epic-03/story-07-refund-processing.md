## Technical Implementation Notes

### Refund Processing Architecture
```typescript
interface RefundProcessor {
  processRefund(request: RefundRequest): Promise<RefundResult>;
  getRefundStatus(refundId: string): Promise<RefundStatus>;
  validateRefundRequest(request: RefundRequest): ValidationResult;
}

interface RefundRequest {
  originalTransactionId: string;
  refundAmount: Decimal;
  refundReason: RefundReason;
  staffMemberId: string;
  supportingDocuments?: string[];
  customerNotification: boolean;
}

enum RefundReason {
  CUSTOMER_CANCELLATION = 'customer_cancellation',
  SERVICE_ISSUE = 'service_issue',
  BILLING_ERROR = 'billing_error',
  VEHICLE_UNAVAILABLE = 'vehicle_unavailable',
  DAMAGE_DISPUTE = 'damage_dispute',
  OVERCHARGE = 'overcharge',
  GOODWILL = 'goodwill'
}
```

### Payment Gateway Integration
- **Card Refunds:** Direct integration with Stripe/Datatrans refund APIs
- **Twint Refunds:** Twint merchant API refund functionality
- **Cash Refunds:** Internal approval workflow with physical cash management
- **Failure Handling:** Retry logic and alternative refund methods

### Database Design
```sql
-- Refund transactions
CREATE TABLE refund_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    original_transaction_id UUID REFERENCES payment_transactions(id),
    refund_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    refund_reason ENUM('customer_cancellation', 'service_issue', 'billing_error', 
                       'vehicle_unavailable', 'damage_dispute', 'overcharge', 'goodwill'),
    refund_method ENUM('original_card', 'original_twint', 'cash', 'bank_transfer', 'alternative'),
    status ENUM('pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed', 'cancelled'),
    gateway_refund_id VARCHAR(255),
    staff_member_id UUID REFERENCES staff_users(id),
    supervisor_approval_id UUID REFERENCES staff_users(id),

    refund_receipt_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    initiated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,

    notes TEXT
);

-- Refund approvals
CREATE TABLE refund_approvals (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    refund_transaction_id UUID REFERENCES refund_transactions(id),
    approval_type ENUM('cash_refund', 'large_amount', 'policy_exception'),
    requested_by UUID REFERENCES staff_users(id),

    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    refund_transaction_id UUID REFERENCES refund_transactions(id),
    document_type ENUM('damage_photo', 'receipt', 'email', 'invoice', 'other'),
    document_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    document_name VARCHAR(255),
    uploaded_by UUID REFERENCES staff_users(id),
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Database Schema Requirements

### Core Tables
- `refund_transactions` - Master refund records with complete lifecycle
- `refund_approvals` - Approval workflow tracking for high-risk refunds
- `refund_documents` - Supporting documentation for refund justification
- `refund_receipts` - Generated refund receipts and confirmations

### Indexes Required
- `refund_transactions(original_transaction_id, status)`
- `refund_transactions(status, initiated_at DESC)`
- `refund_approvals(approval_status, requested_at DESC)`
- `refund_transactions(refund_method, completed_at)`

### Constraints
- Refund amount cannot exceed original transaction amount
- Refund status transitions must follow defined workflow
- Approval timestamps must be after request timestamps
- Supporting documents must have valid URLs

## UI/UX Considerations

### Refund Initiation Interface
- **Transaction Lookup:** Quick search for original transaction
- **Amount Calculator:** Auto-populate full amount with option to modify
- **Reason Selection:** Dropdown with common refund reasons
- **Document Upload:** Drag-and-drop interface for supporting documents

### Approval Workflow Interface
- **Pending Approvals Queue:** Prioritized list of refunds awaiting approval
- **Approval Details:** Complete refund context with original transaction
- **Quick Approval:** One-click approval for routine refunds
- **Bulk Approval:** Process multiple similar refunds simultaneously

### Customer Communication Interface
- **Status Dashboard:** Real-time refund status for customer inquiries
- **Notification Templates:** Pre-written email templates for refund updates
- **Multi-language Support:** Refund communications in customer's language
- **Receipt Generation:** Professional refund receipts with clear details

### Mobile Refund Processing
- **Field Refunds:** Process refunds directly from mobile devices
- **Photo Documentation:** Capture supporting evidence on mobile
- **Push Notifications:** Real-time alerts for approval requests
- **Offline Capability:** Queue refunds when connectivity is limited
