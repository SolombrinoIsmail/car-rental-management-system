## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Roadside Flat Tire
**Given:** Customer reports flat tire on highway during business hours
**When:** Staff initiates emergency recovery process
**Then:** Roadside assistance dispatched within 30 minutes, customer receives regular updates, tire changed on-site

### Scenario 2: Engine Breakdown in Remote Area
**Given:** Vehicle breaks down in rural location with poor cell coverage
**When:** Customer uses offline emergency reporting
**Then:** Location data captured, towing service dispatched to GPS coordinates, replacement vehicle arranged

### Scenario 3: After-Hours Emergency
**Given:** Customer stranded at 2 AM with dead battery
**When:** Emergency hotline processes breakdown report
**Then:** 24-hour roadside service contacted, customer assisted within 45 minutes, jump-start successful

### Scenario 4: Multiple Simultaneous Breakdowns
**Given:** 3 vehicles experience issues during peak travel period
**When:** Staff manages multiple emergency recoveries
**Then:** Priority system manages queue, resources allocated efficiently, all customers assisted within SLA

### Scenario 5: Customer Safety Emergency
**Given:** Vehicle accident with customer injury reported
**When:** Emergency services coordination triggered
**Then:** Ambulance and police contacted immediately, insurance notified, family contacted per emergency contacts

### Scenario 6: High-Cost Recovery Situation
**Given:** Luxury vehicle requires specialized towing and repair
**When:** Recovery costs exceed $2,000 threshold
**Then:** Manager approval required, insurance claim initiated, customer liability calculated and communicated

### Scenario 7: Service Provider No-Show
**Given:** Scheduled towing service fails to arrive as promised
**When:** Customer reports continued waiting after ETA expires
**Then:** Alternative provider automatically contacted, customer compensation calculated, provider performance noted

### Scenario 8: Customer Refuses Assistance
**Given:** Customer reports breakdown but declines company-provided recovery services
**When:** Customer wants to handle recovery independently
**Then:** Customer liability documented, rental agreement impact explained, self-service return process initiated
