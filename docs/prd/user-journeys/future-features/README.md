# Future Features - User Journeys

These journeys represent **NICE-TO-HAVE** features that should be implemented AFTER the MVP is
successful.

## Why These Are NOT in MVP

These journeys were moved to future features because:

1. They add complexity without core value
2. They require features not in MVP scope
3. They can be handled manually initially
4. They represent optimizations, not essentials

## Phase 2 Features (Months 4-6 Post-Launch)

- **04 - Create Reservation** ❌ Requires advance booking system
- **05 - Reservation to Rental** ❌ Requires reservation management
- **06 - Handle No-Show** ❌ Requires reservation tracking
- **07 - Cancellation Process** ❌ Requires refund policies

- **12 - Overdue Management** ❌ Requires notification system
- **15 - Vehicle Preparation** ❌ Can be manual process

- **02 - End of Day Reconciliation** ❌ Manual process acceptable
- **03 - Shift Handover** ❌ Not needed for small teams

### Fleet Analytics
