# Critical MVP Journey Additions

## Final MVP Journey Count: 20 (was 16, added 4 critical)

## The 4 Critical Additions

### 1. üîß Initial System Setup (Journey 00)

**Why Critical:** System unusable without configuration

- One-time 15-minute setup
- Company details, VAT, bank info
- Required for QR-bills and legal compliance
- Gates all other operations

### 2. ‚ùå Contract Correction (Journey 20)

**Why Critical:** 5-10% of contracts have mistakes

- Wrong dates, prices, vehicles
- Legal documents cannot be wrong
- No workaround without void capability
- Daily occurrence

### 3. üîç Find Active Rental (Journey 21)

**Why Critical:** Different from historical lookup

- Customer returns without paperwork
- Need to find by license plate
- Required for walk-in returns
- Multiple times daily

### 4. üîê Password Reset (Journey 39)

**Why Critical:** Weekly occurrence minimum

- No email automation in MVP
- Staff productivity blocked
- Admin-controlled for security
- No self-service option

## Why ONLY These 4

We consciously did NOT add:

- ‚ùå **Payment retry/failure** - Just mark unpaid, handle manually
- ‚ùå **Deposit handling** - Too complex for MVP, use manual process
- ‚ùå **Report export** - Can screenshot/print for now
- ‚ùå **Bulk operations** - Not needed for small volumes
- ‚ùå **Notifications** - Check actively, no automation
- ‚ùå **Data import** - One-time manual entry acceptable
- ‚ùå **Price overrides** - Void and recreate with correct price
- ‚ùå **Refund processing** - Handle outside system initially

- Critical for Day 1 operations
- Still achievable in 16-20 week timeline
- Prevents major support issues

## Success Criteria

MVP cannot launch without: ‚úÖ All 20 journeys implemented ‚úÖ Each tested with real users ‚úÖ Combined
daily journey time < 15 minutes ‚úÖ Manual workarounds documented for gaps

---

_These 20 journeys represent the absolute minimum for operational viability._
