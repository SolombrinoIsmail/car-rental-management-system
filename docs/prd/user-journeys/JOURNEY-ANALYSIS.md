# User Journey Analysis for MVP

## Executive Summary

From 51 documented user journeys, we've identified:
- **16 journeys ESSENTIAL for MVP** → `mvp/` folder
- **12 journeys for FUTURE FEATURES** → `future-features/` folder  
- **23 journeys in original documentation** → Reference only

## MVP Journey Selection Criteria

A journey was included in MVP if it:
1. ✅ Directly enables core value proposition (2-minute contracts)
2. ✅ Captures revenue (fuel/km tracking)
3. ✅ Prevents business failure (double-bookings, lost revenue)
4. ✅ Required for legal compliance (contracts, backup)
5. ✅ Has no acceptable manual workaround

A journey was EXCLUDED from MVP if it:
1. ❌ Requires features not in MVP scope (reservations, emails)
2. ❌ Can be handled manually initially (deposits, shift handover)
3. ❌ Represents optimization not survival (dashboards, analytics)
4. ❌ Adds complexity without proportional value
5. ❌ Used less than daily by most customers
