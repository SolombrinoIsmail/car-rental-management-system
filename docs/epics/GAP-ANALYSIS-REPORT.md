# üîç Epic Gap Analysis Report - Deep Dive

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of the PRD, 41 MVP user journeys, and 6 created epics, I've identified
**critical gaps** that could impact operational readiness. While the epics cover 80% of
requirements, **20% of critical operational scenarios are missing**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL MISSING AREAS

### 1. **Photo Documentation System** (MISSING EPIC)

**Impact:** Legal liability, dispute resolution impossible

#### Not Covered in Any Epic:

- Vehicle condition photos (4 angles minimum)
- Damage marking on photos
- Customer ID/license photo capture
- Photo compression and storage
- PDF embedding of photos
- Before/after comparison

#### User Journeys Affected:

- 08, 09 (New rentals) - Need ID photos
- 13, 14 (Returns) - Need damage comparison
- 25 (Accident report) - Need incident photos

**RECOMMENDATION:** Create **Epic 7: Photo Documentation & Evidence Management**

### 2. **Dispute & Exception Management** (MISSING EPIC)

**Impact:** Customer satisfaction, revenue loss

#### Not Covered:

- Price dispute resolution (Journey 28)
- Damage dispute process
- Fuel calculation disputes
- Contract void/cancellation workflow
- Manager override capabilities
- Dispute documentation

#### Critical Journeys Missing:

- 28 - Price dispute resolution
- Customer claiming different price
- Damage disagreements
- Billing disputes

**RECOMMENDATION:** Create **Epic 8: Dispute & Exception Handling**

### 3. **Edge Case Operations** (PARTIALLY MISSING)

**Impact:** Daily operations blocked

#### Missing from Current Epics:

- **Lost Key Process** (Journey 40) - Not in any epic
- **After-Hours Return** (Journey 26) - Not covered
- **Vehicle Swap Mid-Rental** (Journey 24) - Not in Fleet epic
- **Accident Reporting** (Journey 25) - Not covered
- **Duplicate Customer Merge** (Journey 27) - Not in Customer epic
- **Initial System Setup** (Journey 00) - Partially in Admin

**RECOMMENDATION:** Expand Epic 1 or create **Epic 9: Operational Edge Cases**

### 4. **Shift & Handover Management** (MISSING)

**Impact:** Multi-staff operations

#### Not Covered:

- Shift handover process (Journey 03)
- Outstanding items transfer
- Cash reconciliation between shifts
- Staff activity tracking by shift

## üí∞ Impact on Timeline & Budget

### Additional Effort Required:

- **Epic 7 (Photos):** 10-12 days
- **Epic 8 (Disputes):** 8-10 days
- **Epic 9 (Edge Cases):** 10-12 days
- **Epic Expansions:** 5-8 days
- **Total Additional:** 33-42 days

### Revised Timeline:

- **Original:** 108-133 days
- **Revised:** 141-175 days
- **Impact:** +4-6 weeks

### Options:

1. **Accept longer timeline** - Do it right
2. **Defer reservations** - Save 16-20 days
3. **Simplify edge cases** - Manual processes
4. **Add developer** - Parallel tracks

## ‚úÖ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Create Epic 7** for Photo Documentation (CRITICAL)
2. **Create Epic 8** for Dispute Management
3. **Create Epic 9** for Edge Cases
4. **Expand Epic 1** with missing journeys
5. **Expand Epic 2** with vehicle prep/swap
6. **Consider deferring Epic 5** (Reservations) to Phase 2

### Priority Adjustments:

1. Photos MUST be in MVP (legal requirement)
2. Basic disputes MUST be handled
3. Common edge cases NEED coverage
4. Reservations CAN wait (60% walk-ins)

### Risk Mitigation:

- Without photos: HIGH legal risk
- Without disputes: HIGH customer risk
- Without edge cases: MEDIUM operational risk
- Without reservations: LOW business risk

## üé¨ Conclusion

The current 6 epics provide a **good foundation** but miss **critical operational capabilities**.
Adding the 3 recommended epics and expanding existing ones will ensure:

1. **Legal compliance** (photos)
2. **Operational completeness** (edge cases)
3. **Customer satisfaction** (disputes)
4. **Day 1 readiness** (setup)

The system cannot launch without photo documentation and basic dispute handling. These are not "nice
to have" - they are **operational necessities**.
