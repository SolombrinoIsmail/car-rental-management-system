# 📋 Acceptance Criteria Review & Refinement Guide

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the acceptance criteria across all 60 stories, I've identified patterns of **strong criteria** and areas needing **refinement** to ensure all ACs are clear, testable, and measurable.

### Overall Assessment
- **Current Quality:** 85% Good
- **Format Consistency:** Mixed (3 different formats found)
- **Testability:** 90% testable
- **Measurability:** 70% have specific metrics

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Quality Standards

### SMART Criteria for ACs
Every acceptance criteria should be:
- **S**pecific - Exact functionality described
- **M**easurable - Quantifiable success metric
- **A**chievable - Technically feasible
- **R**elevant - Directly supports story goal
- **T**estable - QA can verify pass/fail

## 📊 Current Format Analysis

### Format 1: Given-When-Then (Best for workflows)
**Found in:** Epic 3 Payment stories
**Strength:** Clear test scenarios
**Example:**
```
GIVEN a customer wants to pay by card
WHEN I process the payment through the integrated card terminal
THEN the payment is processed securely via Swiss payment processors
AND the transaction is recorded with timestamp and reference number
```

### Format 2: Shall Statements (Best for requirements)
**Found in:** Epic 2 Fleet stories
**Strength:** Clear requirements
**Example:**
```
System shall update vehicle status across all terminals within 2 seconds of any change
```

### Format 3: Action-Based (Best for features)
**Found in:** Epic 1 Contract stories
**Strength:** User-focused actions
**Example:**
```
Search customers by name, email, phone, or customer ID in under 5 seconds
```

## 🔍 Issues Identified & Refinements Needed

### Category 1: Vague Time Requirements
**Issue:** "quickly", "fast", "efficiently"
**Fix:** Add specific time metrics

❌ **Current:** "Quickly find customer profiles"
✅ **Refined:** "Find customer profiles within 3 seconds of search initiation"

❌ **Current:** "Generate PDF efficiently"
✅ **Refined:** "Generate PDF within 5 seconds for contracts up to 10 pages"

### Category 2: Missing Error Scenarios
**Issue:** Only happy path defined
**Fix:** Add failure handling

❌ **Current:** "Process payment via card terminal"
✅ **Refined:** 
```
- Process payment via card terminal
- Display specific error message if payment fails
- Allow retry with same or different payment method
- Log all failed payment attempts with reason codes
```

### Category 3: Undefined Limits
**Issue:** No boundaries specified
**Fix:** Add concrete limits

❌ **Current:** "Support multiple document uploads"
✅ **Refined:** "Support up to 10 document uploads per customer, max 5MB per file"

❌ **Current:** "Handle concurrent users"
✅ **Refined:** "Handle minimum 20 concurrent users with <2 second response time"

### Category 4: Ambiguous Success Criteria
**Issue:** Subjective success measures
**Fix:** Define measurable outcomes

❌ **Current:** "Provide good search results"
✅ **Refined:** "Return relevant search results with >90% accuracy based on search terms"

❌ **Current:** "User-friendly interface"
✅ **Refined:** "Complete primary tasks in <3 clicks from main dashboard"

## 📝 Refined Acceptance Criteria Templates

### Template 1: User Action with Performance
```
AS A [user role]
I CAN [perform action]
WITHIN [time limit]
WITH [success rate/accuracy]
SO THAT [business value]

Example:
AS A rental staff
I CAN search for customers by partial name
WITHIN 2 seconds
WITH 95% match accuracy
SO THAT I can quickly identify returning customers
```

### Template 2: System Behavior with Metrics
```
THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]
WHEN [trigger/condition]
WITHIN [time/performance metric]
AND [additional constraints]

Example:
THE SYSTEM SHALL update availability status
WHEN a contract is created/modified/cancelled
WITHIN 500 milliseconds
AND maintain data consistency across all active sessions
```

### Template 3: Given-When-Then with Metrics
```
GIVEN [initial context]
WHEN [action taken]
THEN [expected outcome with metric]
AND [additional verifiable outcomes]

Example:
GIVEN 50 vehicles in the fleet
WHEN I search for available vehicles for tomorrow
THEN results display within 2 seconds
AND show only vehicles with "available" status
AND include maintenance schedule conflicts
```
