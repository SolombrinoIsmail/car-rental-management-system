- PII data masking
- GDPR compliance
- Audit logging

### Infrastructure Security
- Network segmentation
- WAF protection
- SSL/TLS termination
- Security scanning

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- Node.js/TypeScript
- Express.js/Fastify

    participant C as Client
    participant GW as API Gateway
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant B as Booking Service
    participant V as Vehicle Service
    participant P as Payment Service
    participant N as Notification Service
    
    C->>GW: Create booking request
    GW->>A: Validate token
    A-->>GW: Token valid
    GW->>B: Process booking
    B->>V: Check availability
    V-->>B: Vehicle available
    B->>P: Create payment intent
    P-->>B: Payment intent created
    B->>N: Send confirmation
    N-->>C: Email/SMS sent
    B-->>GW: Booking confirmed
    GW-->>C: Success response
```

## Integration Points
